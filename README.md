A simple tool to explore a TrueType font content as a tree.
With a final goal to define each byte in a font.

## Build & Run

`ttf-explorer` depends on [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
so you have to install them first.

You also need a C++ compiler with C++17 support.

And then:

```sh
# On Linux (assuming you have Qt and pkg-config installed)
cargo build --release

# On Windows/macOS
QT_DIR=/path/to/qt cargo build --release
```
